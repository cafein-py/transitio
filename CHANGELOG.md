## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository scaffold: maturin build with a stub ``beanpicker._core`` Rust
  crate, CI for lint/tests and release wheels.
- ``beanpicker.exceptions`` module with ``BeanpickerError``,
  ``MissingTokenError``, ``DownloadError`` and ``ExtractNotFoundError``.
- No-token fallback for the catalog: without a refresh token,
  ``search_feeds`` now searches the Mobility Database CSV catalogue export
  (with a ``UserWarning``) instead of failing; ``Feed`` carries
  ``latest_dataset_url`` and ``download_latest`` fetches the hosted latest
  dataset zip in both modes.
- OSM module (``beanpicker.fetch_pbf``): AOI-driven extract acquisition on
  top of pyrosm — smallest-covering-extract resolution from pyrosm's bundled
  Geofabrik index, cached download, polygon-true cropping via
  ``pyrosm.OSM(...).to_pbf``, place-name AOIs via Nominatim geocoding, and a
  provenance sidecar per file.
- Mobility Database catalog client (``beanpicker.MobilityDatabase``):
  token-refresh authentication, feed search by AOI bounding box, country,
  subdivision and municipality, historical dataset listing with
  date-coverage selection, cached checksum-verified dataset download with a
  provenance sidecar, and hosted validation-report retrieval.
