"""The OSM route-relation extraction contract (distance-tier 3 intake).

The committed ``helsinki-transit.osm.pbf`` fixture (a transit-only
subset of the pinned metro clip) carries every PT route relation, so the
contract battery runs everywhere, CI included; only the deep
whole-extract checks need the locally generated metro clip.
