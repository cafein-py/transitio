"""Mode graphs and stop-to-stop shortest paths — map matching.

A `ModeGraph` is a directed vertex/edge graph in projected meters with
a KD-tree for stop snapping and a per-pair path cache. Connectivity
rests on OSM node identity, never on coordinates — coincident but
distinct vertices (grade-separated tracks, a bridge over a street)
must not become junctions. Rail-family graphs build from the
node-identity rail-way extraction; the bus graph builds from a pyrosm
street network resolved through the PSV permission chain (endpoints
keyed by their ``u``/``v`` node ids, interior vertices edge-local),
with the graph split at every barrier node whose bus access is not an
explicit allow.

Shortest paths respect that Dijkstra is single-source: consecutive
stop pairs group by snapped source vertex, one bounded run per
distinct source serves all its targets (``limit`` pruned by the detour
bound), and pair results are cached across patterns. A segment whose
stops do not snap, whose target is unreachable within the bound, or
whose path exceeds the detour bound of its crow-fly fails — the
pattern falls through the ladder.
