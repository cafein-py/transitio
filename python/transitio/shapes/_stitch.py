"""The member-way stitcher — the relation chain builder.

Turns a route relation's way members into one continuous LineString.
Relation member order leads: OSM defines it as the travel order for
``route=*`` relations, the extraction contract pins it, and real routes
revisit intersections (crossings, terminal loops) that adjacency alone
cannot disambiguate — so when the ordered-next member connects it is
taken without polling the others, and the downstream validation gates
(stop snapping, monotone linear referencing, length sanity) backstop a
corrupted order. Only when order breaks — shuffled members — does the
walk fall back to adjacency, and there it continues solely on a unique
candidate. Anything ambiguous or broken **refuses instead of
repairing** (`StitchRefusal` with a reason code): a gap beyond
tolerance, more than one continuation candidate, an unresolvable
member, or a closed ring whose travel direction cannot be verified.
Refusal leaves the pattern to the next inference strategy — an
honest fallthrough beats a guessed geometry.
