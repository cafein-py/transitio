Reads route relations through pyrosm (the only OSM stack): every
relation tagged ``type=route`` with a public-transport ``route=`` value,
its ordered members with roles, member-way geometries and the way tags
the stitcher consumes, and stop/platform member coordinates. Members
whose element falls outside the extract resolve to ``None`` geometry —

guesses.
